    Revolutions - Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea</a><strong><br><br>Abstract</strong>
    - This paper uses a historic big push intervention with  digitized data from South
    Korea to study the effects of industrial  policy on (short- and long-run) industrial
    development. In 1973 South  Korea transitioned to a military dictatorship and
    drastically changed  their development strategy. I find industries targeted by
    the regime''s  big push grew significantly more than non-targeted industries along  several
    key dimensions of industrial development. These developmental  effects persisted
    after industrial policies were retrenched, following  the 1979 assassination of
    the president. Furthermore, I estimate the  spillovers of the industrial policies
    using exogenous variation in the  exposure to the policy across the input-output
    network. I find evidence  of persistent pecuniary externalities like those posited
    by big push  development theorists, such as Albert Hirschman. In other words,
    I find  that South Korea’s controversial industrial policy was successful in  producing
    industrial development, the benefits of which persisted  through time and in industries
    not directly targeted by the policies.   '
